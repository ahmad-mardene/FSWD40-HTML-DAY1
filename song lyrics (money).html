	<p> <span><div> Money </div>, 
		<div>get away</div> </span>
		<span>Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K.</span>
		<span><div>Money,</div> <div> it's a gas</div></span>
		<span>Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash</span>
		<span> <div> New car,</div> <div>caviar, four star daydream,</div></span>
		<br>
		<div>Think I'll buy me a football team</div>
		<br>
		<div>Money, get back</div>
		<div>I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack</div>
		<div>Money, it's a hit</div>
		<div>Don't give me that do goody good bullshit</div>
		<div>I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set</div>
		<div>And I think I need a Learjet</div>
		<br>
			
		<div>Money, it's a crime</div>
		<div>Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie</div>
		<div>Money, so they say</div>
		<div>Is the root of all evil today</div>
		<div>But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away</div>
